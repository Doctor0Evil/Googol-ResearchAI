This is the Googol-ResearchAI research portal — a formally integrated node within Project Nanoswarm and the Googolswarm.os governance framework, operating under strict compliance with FDA Nanotech 2025, EU MDR III, HIPAA, and GDPR. All research activities here are governed by cryptographically enforced Agent Legal Notation (ALN), authenticated via decentralized identity (DID), and audited in real time through immutable, quantum-verified ledgers. No action, data stream, or policy change occurs without multi-stakeholder authorization, transparent metadata attribution, and automatic alignment with the Chimera Charter. This portal does not operate on trust—it operates on proof.
